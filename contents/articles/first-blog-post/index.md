Hi, my name is **JC Ivancevich**, I'm a software developer who lives in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

I'm 24 years old and **extremely passionate about programming** stuff.

Currently, I'm working for a **great MBaaS company** called **[KidoZen](http://www.kidozen.com)**, doing a lot of `JavaScript`.

I plan to post lots of interesting things here, related to **software development** of course.

If you want to contact me, you can catch me on [Github](https://github.com/ivancevich), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ivancevich), [LinkedIn](http://ar.linkedin.com/in/ivancevich) or [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+JuanCarlosIvancevich).


Hopefully, **this is the beginning of something great** :)

Cheers!
